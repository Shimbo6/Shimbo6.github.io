          <p>
            Mimosa Pudica, a seemingly simple yet beautiful plant from afar may
            be holding a larger mystery than we once realised, but be sure not
            to say anything too cruel to this sensitive plant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I get into its mystery, let me tell you about the unique
            Mimosa Pudica plant. Also known as a sensitive plant or Shameplant,
            the Mimosa Pudica reacts in rapid movement to stimuli, such as touch
            or movement, with its leaves folding in and its branches drooping
            causing the plant to look dead in seconds. Within 10 – 20 minutes,
            its beautiful leaves and branches return to normal as though nothing
            ever happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this unusual behaviour wasn’t enough to intrigue your attention
            on this popular houseplant, then perhaps the studies performed by
            Monica Gagliano will.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014, Monica Gagliano released her most well-known study on the
            fascinating behaviour of the Mimosa Pudica. The experiment included
            dropping the plant over and over until it no longer reacted to the
            sensation of falling and to prove that the plants' lack of reaction
            wasn’t just exhaustion (we’ve all been there), they would then shake
            the plant to see its reaction. The sensitive plant that no longer
            reacted to being dropped would furl up the moment it was shaken,
            proving that it could learn that certain stimuli would do it no
            harm. Further experiments showed that the plant would continue not
            reacting to being dropped for 28 days after, suggesting that the
            plant also had the capacity for some form of memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few unconfirmed theories as to these unique plants
            ability to learn and remember but it seems that the full mystery of
            the anxious Mimosa Pudica is yet to be revealed.
